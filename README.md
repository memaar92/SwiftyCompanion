# Swifty Companion

Swifty Companion is part of the 42 advanced curriculum and designed to explore the fundamentals of app development. As I had dabbled in iOS development before, I decided to build the project as a native iOS app using Swift. The app integrates with the 42 API to provide detailed information about any 42 student, including their profile, skills, and completed projects.

## Implemented features include:
- Sign in with 42
- Authentication Management using the Actor protocol
- Keychain storage of access token
- Profile View
- Detail View showcasing projects and skills
- List and search for peers (with infinite scroll and option to filter for active peers)
